**Step 1: Setting Up the Hardware**

  Arduino Board: Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB.
  Camera Module: Connect the camera module to the Arduino. The OV7670 camera module can be connected to the Arduino using SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) or I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit). For simplicity, we'll assume SPI connection in this example.
  LED: Connect an LED to the Arduino. You can use a simple LED with a resistor to limit current. Connect one leg of the LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 13), and the other leg through the resistor to ground.
  
**Step 2: Installing Required Libraries**

  Before writing the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:
  OpenCV: Install the OpenCV library for Arduino. This library provides functions for image processing and computer vision tasks.
  SPI: Install the SPI library if you're using SPI to connect the camera module.

**Psuedo Code**

#include <SPI.h>
#include <OpenCV.h>

// Define pins
#define LED_PIN 13

// Initialize OpenCV
OpenCV cv;

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Initialize LED
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  
  // Initialize OpenCV
  cv.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // Capture frame from camera
  cv.capture();

  // Convert frame to grayscale
  cv.cvtColor(cv.COLOR_RGB2GRAY);

  // Apply thresholding to detect people (adjust threshold value as needed)
  cv.threshold(cv, 100, 255, cv.THRESH_BINARY_INV);

  // Find contours in the thresholded image
  cv.findContours(cv, cv.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE);

  // Check if any contours (people) were detected
  if (cv.contours.size() > 0) {
    // Turn on LED (red)
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    // Turn off LED (green)
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  }

  // Delay for a bit to reduce CPU usage
  delay(100);
}


**Notes:**

  Camera Connection: The code assumes an SPI connection for the camera module. Adjust the connection method according to your specific hardware setup.
  OpenCV Configuration: The OpenCV library for Arduino might require specific configuration depending on the camera module and the Arduino board you're using. Refer to the OpenCV library documentation for details on initializing and configuring the library.
  Threshold Value: The threshold value in cv.threshold() might need adjustment based on the lighting conditions and the specific characteristics of the basketball court. Experiment with different values to optimize detection accuracy.
  Performance: Processing video frames in real-time on an Arduino can be computationally intensive. Consider optimizing the code or using a more powerful microcontroller if performance is an issue.
